# React + TypeScript + Material-UI

If this project proves to be useful, it is by standing on the soulders of Giants.

This project is a mere fork, with some changes, of its increadible predecessors:

- [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate)
- [react-boilerplate-typescript](https://github.com/Can-Sahin/react-boilerplate-typescript)

## Quick start

1. Make sure that you have Node.js v8.10 and npm v5 or above installed.
2. Clone this repo using `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`
3. Move to the appropriate directory: `cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`.
4. Run `npm run setup` in order to install dependencies and clean the git repo.
5. Optionally, run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`.
6. Run `npm run clean` to delete the example app.

Now you're ready to rumble!

> Please note that this boilerplate is **production-ready and not meant for beginners**! If you're just starting out with react or redux, please refer to https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto instead. If you want a solid, battle-tested base to build your next product upon and have some experience with react, this is the perfect start for you.
